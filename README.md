## Hi there 👋

I am Christian Schreinemachers and I am interested in science, open source software, podcasts, boardgames, music, movies, literature, and much more.

I hold a 🎓 PhD in chemistry, which I did in the [SOLVOMET Group](https://chem.kuleuven.be/solvomet/) of [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/) 🇧🇪 and at the [Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK CEN](https://www.sckcen.be/en).
Currently, I work as 👨‍🔬 scientist at the [Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en) 🇩🇪 in the [Nuclear Waste Management](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/iek/iek-6) department of the [Institute of Energy and Climate Research](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/iek).

In my spare time, I am developing a python package which allows to organise ☢ X-ray diffraction measurement data and access them via an API. 
Due to my aversion to Microsoft products, I am developing this package on [codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org).
Feel free to visit my [codeberg profile](https://codeberg.org/Cs137/), the [project repository](https://codeberg.org/Cs137/xrdt) and/or its [documentation](https://cs137.codeberg.page/xrdt/).

Moreover, I created a LaTeX class that allows to compile documentation files for experimental data ([example](https://zenodo.org/record/3841374/)).
This project is still private, but reach out to me if you would like to access its source code (and/or are interested in helping me to publish it).

I write quite regularly on Mastodon about developments and technology topics in general. 
I have accounts on two instances:

  My personal account. Technology, culture, media, nerd stuff, 🌱 veganism.
